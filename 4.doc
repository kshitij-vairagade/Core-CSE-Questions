4) What is the difference between exec and fork?

A) fork and exec both are system calls that are used to create & start a new process.

fork =>
fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process, The new process, referred to as child, is an exact duplicate of the calling process, referred to as parent

exec =>
exec() replaces the current process image with a new process image. It loads the program into the current process space and runs it from the entry point.

fork starts a new process which is a copy of the one that calls it, while exec replaces the current process image with different one.
Both parent and child processes are executed simultaneously in case of fork() while Control never returns to the original program unless there is an exec() error.
