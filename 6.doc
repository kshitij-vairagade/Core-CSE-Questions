6) What is swap and what is it used for?

A) Swap is a space on a disk that is used when the amount of physical RAM memory is full. When a Linux system runs out of RAM, inactive pages are moved from the RAM to the swap space.

Swap space can take the form of either a dedicated swap partition or a swap file. In most cases, when running Linux on a virtual machine, a swap partition is not present, so the only option is to create a swap file.

Swap is used to give processes room, even when the physical RAM of the system is already used up. In a normal system configuration, when a system faces memory pressure, swap is used, and later when the memory pressure disappears and the system returns to normal operation, swap is no longer used.
