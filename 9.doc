9) What is the CAP theorem? Give examples of each.

A) The CAP(Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error;
Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write;
Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes) theorem is a tool used to makes system designers aware of the trade-offs while designing networked shared-data systems. CAP has influenced the design of many distributed data systems, it made designers aware of a wide range of tradeoffs to consider while designing distributed data systems.

The CAP theorem implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability. Note that consistency as defined in the CAP theorem is quite different from the consistency guaranteed in ACID database transactions.

The CAP theorem states that a distributed database system has to make a tradeoff between Consistency and Availability when a Partition occurs.
