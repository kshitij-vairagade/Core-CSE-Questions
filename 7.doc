A) To change file and directory permissions, we can use the command "chmod" (change mode). The owner of a file can change the permissions for user (u), group (g), or others (o) by adding (+) or subtracting (-) the read, write, and execute permissions.

Linux divides the file permissions into read, write and execute denoted by r,w, and x.
